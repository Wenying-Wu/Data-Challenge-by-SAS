### Note:
- Explore different types of data sets by validating and preparing relevant data for analysis through the steps of:
	- Data filtering
	- Data formatting
	- Data sorting
	- Conditional processing
- Each challenge requires specific “data steps” to reproduce the expected outcome.  Filter definite rows using conditional processing (i.e., if…, then…), to sort data appropriately as well as to format different data types such as dates.
